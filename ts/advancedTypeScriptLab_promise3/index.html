<!-- Since we are going to be using the fetch API - a new way of creating server requests in JavaScript - we need to make sure to add a polyfill to our index.html file in case fetch isn't available in your browser. A polyfill is a script to ensure that a newer feature implemented in modern browsers is available in older browsers. To do this, we are going to add a script tag above the reference to advancedTypeScriptLab.js in our index.html file referencing the CDNJS copy of the Fetch polyfill.
